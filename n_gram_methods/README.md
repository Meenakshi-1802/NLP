## üß† What is an N-gram?

An **n-gram** is a sequence of `n` words that appear together in a sentence.

| N | Type     | Example (from "I love cats") |
|---|----------|------------------------------|
| 1 | Unigram  | I, love, cats                |
| 2 | Bigram   | I love, love cats            |
| 3 | Trigram  | I love cats                  |

N-grams are very useful in **Natural Language Processing (NLP)** for:
- Chatbots
- Text prediction
- Sentiment analysis
- Spam detection
- And more!
