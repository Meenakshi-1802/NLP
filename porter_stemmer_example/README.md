# ðŸ”¤ Stemming Words using NLTK's PorterStemmer

This notebook explains how to use the **PorterStemmer** from the **NLTK** library to reduce words to their base or root form, a common step in **Natural Language Processing (NLP)**.

## ðŸ“Œ What is Stemming?

**Stemming** is the process of removing prefixes or suffixes from words to reduce them to their **root form**.

For example:
- "playing" â†’ "play"
- "studies" â†’ "studi"
- "running" â†’ "run"

Stemming helps in simplifying text for tasks like:
- Text classification
- Search engines
- Chatbots
- Machine learning models

## ðŸ§  What is PorterStemmer?

The **PorterStemmer** is one of the most widely used stemming algorithms in NLP.  
It applies a series of rules to remove common English suffixes.

Itâ€™s known for being:
- **Simple**
- **Fast**
- **Good for English text**

## ðŸ“š How Does It Work?

Letâ€™s say you have this sentence:
"Before eating, it would be nice to sanitize your hands with a sanitizer."

Using **PorterStemmer**, the sentence becomes:

As you can see:
- "eating" â†’ "eat"
- "sanitize" â†’ "sanit"
- "sanitizer" â†’ "sanit"
- "hands" â†’ "hand"

It trims off parts of words but keeps the **core meaning**.

| Benefit                       | Description                                     |
|------------------------------|-------------------------------------------------|
| ðŸ”„ Reduces word forms        | Helps in treating "run", "running", "runs" the same |
| ðŸ§¹ Simplifies text           | Great for preprocessing before ML models        |
| âš¡ Fast and lightweight       | Works well even on large text datasets          |
| ðŸ“˜ Easy to implement         | Comes built-in with NLTK                        |
